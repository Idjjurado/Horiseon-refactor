# Horiseon-refactor

## Description
This repository is to hold any and all code refactors that are commissioned by "Horiseon"

I made a couple of design changes in reference to continuity on the color scheme. Each location was a different color as opposed to a uniformity of blue.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is to allow accessible usage of the Horiseon website alongside good semantic element usage of code!
